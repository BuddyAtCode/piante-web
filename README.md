## Overview

This website was designed and developed by me!
To be honest, I am not 100% satisfied with the result. I think I have started with the wrong approach considering the complexity of animations.
To be specific, I am not satisfied with responsiveness, which a was challenge to maintain because of the complexity of animations and the wrong approach to those animations from the very beginning.
